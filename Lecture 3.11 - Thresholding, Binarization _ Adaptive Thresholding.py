# ## Thresholding, Binarization & Adaptive Thresholding

# 
# In thresholding, we convert a grey scale image to it's binary form

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load our image as greyscale 
image = cv2.imread('images/gradient.jpg',0)
cv2.imshow('Original', image)

# Values below 127 goes to 0 (black, everything above goes to 255 (white)
ret,thresh1 = cv2.threshold(image, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
cv2.imshow('1 Threshold Binary', thresh1)

# Values below 127 go to 255 and values above 127 go to 0 (reverse of above)
ret,thresh2 = cv2.threshold(image, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
cv2.imshow('2 Threshold Binary Inverse', thresh2)

# Values above 127 are truncated (held) at 127 (the 255 argument is unused)
ret,thresh3 = cv2.threshold(image, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_TRUNC)
cv2.imshow('3 THRESH TRUNC', thresh3)

# Values below 127 go to 0, above 127 are unchanged  
ret,thresh4 = cv2.threshold(image, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_TOZERO)
cv2.imshow('4 THRESH TOZERO', thresh4)

# Resever of above, below 127 is unchanged, above 127 goes to 0
ret,thresh5 = cv2.threshold(image, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV)
cv2.imshow('5 THRESH TOZERO INV', thresh5)
cv2.waitKey(0)

# ### Is there a better way off thresholding?
# 
# The biggest downfall of those simple threshold methods is that we need to provide the threshold value (i.e. the 127 value we used previously).
# #### What if there was a smarter way of doing this?
# 
# There is with, Adaptive thresholding.
